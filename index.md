## Hello World!

I'm no longer keeping this project hosted as I am focusing on other things.

If it weren't for the non-opensource user management script that I had built on I'd just make the whole thing open, maybe that'll be the next move. I could just remove all the user-login stuff. I don't think anyone was actively using this app but if you were, sorry about that. Message me on GitHub or email mdkrieg@mtu.edu (email might get buried).

In memoriam I'll keep this screenshot here:

Best Regards,
