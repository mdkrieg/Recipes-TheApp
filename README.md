# Recipes-TheRoadmap
This section is to keep track of the features to be added next.
## General
- Show the # or % of ingredients in pantry on recipe face
- Nutritional breakdown of recipe

## Collections
Each section should have the ability to save groups of items / recipes
- Collections in recipes
	- Show % of each collection that is in pantry
	- Button to create shoplist from collection
- Collections in pantry
	- Availability options like:
		- "assume I always have"
		- "ask me 1 / month"
		- "ask me 1 / week"
		- I imagine the "ask me" options as an email survey
	- Send directly to shoplist when empty
- Collections in shoplist
	- Similar to above, such as:
		- "Email me every (x) weeks"
		- Possible show household products?
